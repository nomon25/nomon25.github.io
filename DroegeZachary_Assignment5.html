							<h5><strong><a href="#">Eat before a workout </a></strong></h5>
							<p>
								It’s essential to eat before a workout because your body is like an engine and the food is the fuel. In order
								to work at your strongest capacity you need to have some stored up food. That being said don’t eat a large meal
								and then workout, instead wait 1 – 2 hours after a meal and then workout. A essential food resource that your
								body uses for fuel would be carbohydrates. This is the best food group to eat before a workout. &hellip;

							<h5><strong><a href="#">Get enough sleep </a></strong></h5>
							<p>
								Sleep is a vital part of muscle growth and mental well-being. When you’re resting that is when your body is in
								the process of building muscle and rebuilding connective tissue, this results in your body becoming stronger.
								The more time you have to sleep between workouts the more time your body can build the muscle you’ve been

								Protein is essential for initiating muscle protein synthesis (MPS) and is a great way to refuel muscles after a
								workout. Protein is a key component in muscle growth and having some either in a powdered form or with meat
								after a hard exercise can increase the amount of muscle you build when you go to sleep. &hellip;
